# about my exam
1. It was tricky because of heroku, i had to make new repositories multiple times. 
2. in the end i realized it was only because i didnt change the IP address options in Mongo atlas. 
## somehing else about the exam
1. The exam seemed easy at first, reusing components mostly, and adding abit of logic, in the end something wasnt working and i was working on it for a while. unitl i gave up.
2. but i got pretty much all of it done.  
3. I tried using tailwind but it got messy so i just dropped UI customization. 
4. i dont really know what else to talk about. 

### thank you for teaching this subject, i learned alot. I aspire to be a web developer. After graduation ill be job hunting to be a developer.
